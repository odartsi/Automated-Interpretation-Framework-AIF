Run Name in ALAB,"Human Dara Evaluation (0-1, 1 is best)",Reasons for bad evaluation (multiple selection possible),Any phase that should not be present?,Extra comments
11_CaVO2_900,1.0,,,Where the missing peaks are seems wrong
12_CaVO2_900,1.0,,,too many missing peaks
TRI_14,1.0,,,Should indicate that the intensity for major peaks is off
TRI_15,0.5,,CaO2 shouldn't have been identified or fit the way it was,"it's important that when a phase is identified the refinement parameters are chosen such that it actually gets fit to the pattern versus the background (CaO2 only got fit to the background). Also, CaO2 is a peroxide, which is super unstable and shouldn't be there."
TRI_27,0.0,,,"with so little intensity, it would likely be best for the program to not fit this."
TRI_28,0.0,,,"with so little intensity, it would likely be best for the program to not fit this."
TRI_29,1.0,,,"beautiful, would be nice to say that major peaks have missing intensity."
TRI_30,1.0,,,
TRI_31,1.0,,,beautiful intensity fits for major peaks
TRI_32,1.0,,,The missing and extra peaks are confusing for me
TRI_37,0.5,bad intensity fit with only one phase present.,,
TRI_38,1.0,bad intensity fit with only one phase present.,,
TRI_39,1.0,,,"Something about this fit I don't like. I'm not sure why, but it looks fine"

TRI_43,0.5,"phase(s) missing, bad intensity fit with only one phase present.",,
TRI_44,1.0,,,"On borderline, could be a missing phase"
TRI_62,1.0,,,"The missing peak is wrong, and there is a lot of unit intensity."
TRI_63,0.5,extra phase identified that shouldn't be there,,"LiV3O8 is super low weight, and then doesn't actually match to a single peak. "

TRI_77,1.0,,,
TRI_78,1.0,,,
TRI_79,1.0,,,bad intensities
TRI_80,1.0,,,
TRI_81,0.5,phase(s) missing,Li4CO5: I've never heard of it and can't find it anywhere. I don't think should be there probably,
TRI_82,0.5,"extra peaks, missing peaks",,The baseline is fit incorrectly.

TRI_105,0.5,"missing peaks, extra peaks",,"mostly a good fit, but the minor intensity peaks seem unfit/fit slightly off such as around 27. It seems like dara isn't identified the missing intensity here and in some higher angles"
TRI_106,0.5,"extra phase identified that shouldn't be there, phase(s) missing, missing peaks, composition balance, rwp value",CO shouldn't be there,definitely a phase missing from identification
TRI_111,0.5,extra phase identified that shouldn't be there,V14O6 shouldn't be there,
