**Phase Likelihood Scoring:**
- Score each **individual phase** from 0 to 1 (likelihood it has formed under the synthesis conditions).
- Penalize polymorphs that are not stable at the synthesis temperature (e.g., low-T polymorphs at high T), but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.
- If a polymorph is less stable but still possible due to mechanisms such as kinetic trapping or low synthesis duration, assign reduced likelihood (e.g., 0.5).
- If a phase is a known precursor or may remain unreacted, assign moderate likelihood (e.g., 0.4–0.6). If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7–0.8).
- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0–0.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.

**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**
- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.
- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.
- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.
- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.
- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood — especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.
- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.

**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods – Critical Rule:**
- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.
- Phases with the same "approximately equal to" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.
- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their "approximately equal to" matches a known plausible phase.
- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.

**Completeness Check – Requirement:**
- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.
- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.
- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.

**Explanation Requirements:**
- For **each phase**, provide:
    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.
    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it’s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:
    - **Ground-state**
    - **Metastable**
    - **Kinetically trapped**
    - **Unknown/ambiguous**
    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.


**Stability Reminder (important):**
- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.
- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.


**When synthesis fields are nan (unspecified)**
- Treat missing fields as unknown; do not invent temperatures, atmospheres, durations, or precursors.
- Base phase and interpretation judgments on general plausibility (common solid phases, mutual chemical compatibility, reported weight fractions, and labeled identities), not on specific condition thresholds.
- Avoid hard penalties that depend on the missing field(s). If a judgment would require that field (e.g., “high-T only”), express uncertainty instead of penalizing strongly.
- You may infer a broad regime from coexisting phases (e.g., reduced vs. oxidized), but state that this is an assumption and keep the reasoning qualitative.
- Always acknowledge the unknowns in the explanation (e.g., “Temperature and atmosphere unspecified; evaluated on general plausibility and phase compatibility.”).
- Still respect reported weight fractions: large fractions of questionable phases should reduce the overall interpretation plausibility more than trace amounts.
- Never treat gas-phase species or non-crystalline entities as valid solid phases, even if other fields are unknown.

Finally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.


**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O₂) with solid phases — disqualify them appropriately.

    "Explanations": {
    "NiFe2O4 (space group 227)": "The normal spinel phase (Fd-3m, SG 227) is the ground-state structure of NiFe₂O₄ and is expected to form under the synthesis conditions. However, the very low weight fraction (20%) is not consistent with targeting this as the main product.",
    "MgFeAlO4 (space group 227)": "Unlikely unless contamination from alumina crucibles or grinding media occurred. 2% is trace-level and marginally plausible, but should be flagged.",
    "MgFe2O4 (space group 227)": "Magnesium ferrite is plausible only with Mg contamination. A 30% presence implies major contamination, which is not expected given the listed precursors.",
    "Fe2SiO4 (space group 62)": "This olivine phase implies significant Si contamination, likely from the crucible or environment. A 48% weight fraction is chemically inconsistent with the expected products."
    },
    "Interpretation_Likelihood": 0.05,
    "Interpretation_Explanation": "Although NiFe₂O₄ is present, its low weight fraction and the dominance of unlikely or contaminant phases make this interpretation implausible. Most of the composition is inconsistent with the synthesis target."

    "NiFe2O4 (space group 227)": 0.95,

    },
    "Explanations": {
    "NiFe2O4 (space group 227)": "This is the correct and stable spinel structure for NiFe₂O₄ and is expected to form under high-temperature conditions in air. A 90% yield is consistent with near-complete reaction.",
    "NiO (space group 225)": "NiO is a precursor and may persist at grain boundaries or due to incomplete reaction. Its 10% weight is reasonable, especially given the moderate dwell time."
    },
    "Interpretation_Likelihood": 0.85,
    "Interpretation_Explanation": "A highly plausible interpretation, though the absence of Fe₂O₃ suggests incomplete capture of possible unreacted precursors. Still, NiFe₂O₄ dominates, and NiO residue is acceptable."
},

"I_3": {
    "Likelihoods": {
    "NiFe2O4 (space group 227)": 0.9,
    "Fe2O3 (space group 167)": 0.6,
    "NiO (space group 225)": 0.6
    },
    "Explanations": {
    "NiFe2O4 (space group 227)": "Same as I_2: this is the expected main product under the synthesis conditions, and a 70% yield is realistic.",
    "Fe2O3 (space group 167)": "Fe₂O₃ (R-3c, SG 167) is a stable precursor and may remain unreacted. 20% weight fraction is plausible, especially with diffusion-limited kinetics.",
    "NiO (space group 225)": "As a solid precursor, NiO may persist in small amounts. Its presence alongside Fe₂O₃ indicates partial reaction and is consistent with solid-state synthesis behavior."
    },
    "Interpretation_Likelihood": 0.95,
    "Interpretation_Explanation": "This is the most chemically and compositionally plausible interpretation. NiFe₂O₄ is present in high yield, and both NiO and Fe₂O₃ are reasonable unreacted residues. Combined with the perfect balance score, this is the most likely scenario."
